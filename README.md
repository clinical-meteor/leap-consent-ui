##Architectural View
![High Level Architecture](docs/assets/high-level-architecture.png?raw=true)

The Consent Management Service and UI are just some of the components in a cloud based multi-service framework for the creation and enforcement of a patient's consent.  
This implementation is geared for a deployment at a regional Health Information Exchange (HIE).  However, it's decisioning and enforcement reach is 
not limited to just exchanges between that HIE (custodian) and other entities.
