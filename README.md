#LEAP Consent Management Service and UI
A service (including a user interface) for patients to analyze, create, revoke, reinstate, and audit consents.  Storing them 
in the form of FHIR Consent resources in a FHIR Server (Consent Store).

## Key Features
Patient can;
- Manange all FHIR consents from a single view.
- Create FHIR consents for: Patient-Privacy, Advance Directives, Portable Medical Order (POLST). 
- Utilize FHIR Questionnaire and create a codeified FHIR QuestionnaireResponse for Advance Directives, and POLST.
- Create informed consent for treatment - Medication Requests, Service Requests, and Research Studies. (Experimental)
- Upload and analyze their clinical data in V2, CCDA, FHIR Bundle, and FHIR Resource for confidentialy analysis
- Utilize questionnaire like flow within UI to capture responses.
- Receive notifications of recommended patient-privacy exchange policies, medication requests, service requests, 
and research studies where patient is a possible candidate.
- View all authorization events where access to their clinical record is permitted or denied.  FHIR AuditEvents are generated by the Consent 
Decision Service (CDS) .  
- Capture electronic signatures.
- Support notary flow for advance directives.
- Digitally sign attachments with trusted custodian cert.

##Quick Start
Developers who wish to investigate further you can utilize the services already deployed in the San Diego HealthConnect LEAP project Google cloud.
- Check out this repository:
```
> git clone https://github.com/sdhealthconnect/leap-consent-ui.git
```
- Create leap_consent database:
```
Using mysql client or mysql workbench create empty schema `leap_consent`
```
- Update local configuration files:
```
Modify src/main/resources/config/application-local.yaml and src/main/resources/db/local-liguidbase.properties
to reflect your local mysql enviorment
```
- Load user preferences:
```
> cd leap-consent-ui/leap-consent-ui
> mvn liquibase:update -Plocal
```
- Build it:
```
> mvn clean install -DskipTests
```
- Run it:
```
> export SLS_HOST_URL=http://34.94.253.50:9091
> export HAPI_FHIR_URL=http://34.94.253.50:8080/hapi-fhir-jpaserver/fhir/
> java -jar -Dspring.profiles.active=local -Dvaadin.productionMode=true target/leap-consent-ui-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war
```
- Use it:

The LEAP Consent UI is now available @ http://localhost:8080 10 test users, their preferences, and 
clincial data have been loaded for testing puposes.  

You may also access the deployed version @ https://leap-gui-yop7t2tkfq-uc.a.run.app/login.

##Architectural View
![High Level Architecture](docs/assets/high-level-architecture.png?raw=true)

The Consent Management Service and UI are just some of the components in a cloud based multi-service framework for the creation and enforcement of a patient's consent.  
This implementation is geared for a deployment at a regional Health Information Exchange (HIE).  However, it's decisioning and enforcement reach is 
not limited to just exchanges between that HIE (custodian) and other entities.

##My Consent Documents
This provides the patient with a view of all FHIR consents that are Active, Expired (exceeded provision end date), Revoked (by patient or other workflow), or Pending requiring some 
action from patient.

![My Consent Documents](docs/assets/MyConsentDocuments.png?raw=true)

The patient can retrieve detail information about a specific consent by clicking on the row of interest.  Where they may access details, 
revoke or reinstate that consent, act on requirements for consent in pending state, or view the attached digitally signed human readable form.

##Analyze My Data
This empowers the patient to make an informed decision on whether or not to constrain specific types of data based
on their confidentialy code.  It utilizes the same Security Labeling Service (SLS) used within the LEAP Consent Enforcement 
Services.
